â˜• Momo's Coffee House BI Dashboard
Technologies Used: SQL, Power BI, DAX, Power Query

ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project showcases a full-stack business intelligence solution for a fictional coffee shop, Momo's Coffee House. It combines SQL-based data modeling with dynamic Power BI visualizations to deliver actionable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency.

ðŸ§  Key Features
SQL View Creation: Built a centralized SQL view to clean and structure raw transactional data, including fields like datetime, coffee_name, cash_type, and revenue metrics.

Calendar Table Integration: Created a dynamic calendar table to enable time intelligence features such as Year-to-Date (YTD), weekday analysis, and peak hour detection.

Measures Table Architecture: Designed a dedicated DAX measures table to keep the model clean and scalable â€” ideal for enterprise-level BI development.

Advanced DAX Metrics:

Revenue_YTD

Most_Profitable_Day

Peak_Hour

Top_Coffee

Number_of_Transactions

Power Query Transformations: Extracted date and hour components from datetime, handled data type conversions, and resolved formatting issues for accurate time-based analysis.
